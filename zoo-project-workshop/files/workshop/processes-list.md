## List available processes

The list of processes contains a summary of each process the OGC API - Processes offers, including the link to a more detailed description of the process.

For more information, see <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-062r2/18-062r2.html#sc_process_list">Section 7.9</a>.

The first time we use this endpoint, the list contains only the list of the default processes. Let's say those that are available per default on the server instance.

One may note that the `mutable` property in the process summary is `false` for these processes. It means that the end-user cannot modify them in any way. They can only use them.

As we will see later, this list will change once you have deployed a new process. Follow the next step, and once complete, come back here to get the updated list.
