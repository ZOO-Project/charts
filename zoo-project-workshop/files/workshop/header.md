# Processing Application Deploy, Execution and Results Exploitation

In this section you will be able to deploy and execute a CWL
Application Package named **waterbodies**. 

## Authentification

To be able to use this API, it is required to authenticate using an
OpenID Connect Provider. For the purpose of this workshop, we will use
a basic Keycloack instance. 

To authenticate, please press on the button below, then a window
appear. There, use the following **client_id**:
`EOEPCA-Secured-Client` in the section **OpenIDAuth
(OAuth2,implicit)** from the available authorizations.

You can use your login and the password provided earlier in this
workshop to authenticate.
